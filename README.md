# Multiplex Engine BETA

This was an earlier implementation of the Multiplex Engine I made for [mV3d](https://github.com/JoenTheWizard/mV3D). It has a bit more features though than the implementation in mV3D as I was mainly testing some things.

A lot of the things in it were just experimental so don't expect much

Things it includes are:
- Water rendering
- Instancing
- Shadow Buffers
- Heightmap generation
- A 'first person' model following the camera (acts as flashlight)
- Very basic physics
- Instancing
- Parallax mapping
